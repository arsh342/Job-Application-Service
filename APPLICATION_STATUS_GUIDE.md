# Application Status Management - Job Portal System

## üéØ Overview

The Job Application Service already has a **complete implementation** for managing and displaying application statuses. This document shows how employers can manage application statuses (Accept, Reject, Shortlist, Pending) and how job seekers can view their application status.

## üìä Application Status Types

The system supports four distinct application statuses:

### 1. **APPLIED** (Pending)

- **Color:** Blue (#1976d2)
- **Description:** Initial status when a job seeker submits an application
- **From Employer Perspective:** Application received, awaiting review

### 2. **SHORTLISTED**

- **Color:** Orange (#f57c00)
- **Description:** Employer has reviewed and shortlisted the candidate for further consideration
- **From Employer Perspective:** Candidate moved to interview/evaluation stage

### 3. **HIRED** (Accepted)

- **Color:** Green (#388e3c)
- **Description:** Employer has decided to hire the candidate
- **From Employer Perspective:** Offer made/candidate selected

### 4. **REJECTED**

- **Color:** Red (#d32f2f)
- **Description:** Employer has rejected the application
- **From Employer Perspective:** Application declined

## üîÑ Status Workflow

```
APPLIED ‚Üí SHORTLISTED ‚Üí HIRED
   ‚Üì           ‚Üì
REJECTED ‚Üê REJECTED
```

- Applications start as **APPLIED**
- Employers can move them to **SHORTLISTED**, **HIRED**, or **REJECTED**
- From **SHORTLISTED**, applications can move to **HIRED** or **REJECTED**
- **HIRED** and **REJECTED** are final states

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend (Spring Boot)

#### Models:

```java
public enum ApplicationStatus {
    APPLIED, SHORTLISTED, REJECTED, HIRED
}
```

#### Key Endpoints:

```java
// For Job Seekers
GET /api/applications/my-applications
GET /api/applicants/{applicantId}/applications

// For Employers
PUT /api/applications/{applicationId}/status
GET /api/jobs/{jobId}/applications
```

#### Status Update Request:

```json
{
  "status": "SHORTLISTED" | "HIRED" | "REJECTED"
}
```

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

#### Status Styling:

```css
.status-applied {
  background: #e3f2fd;
  color: #1976d2;
}
.status-shortlisted {
  background: #fff3e0;
  color: #f57c00;
}
.status-rejected {
  background: #ffebee;
  color: #d32f2f;
}
.status-hired {
  background: #e8f5e8;
  color: #388e3c;
}
```

#### Status Update Function:

```javascript
async function updateApplicationStatus(applicationId, newStatus) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/applications/${applicationId}/status`, {
    method: "PUT",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ status: newStatus }),
  });
}
```
